## 🤓 Recommendations

<!-- > I've set up formatting settings for the repo so that everyone's code is standardized. You're welcome! 😊

### After setting up intellisense, go do yourself a favor and fix the default code formatter and configs for Omnisharp:

1. Go to `File > Preferences > Settings > Search: "Editor: Default Formatter"` and change the formatter to C# (ms-dotnettools.csharp)\*
2. Go to `File > Preferences > Settings > Search: "Omnisharp: Use Editor Formatting Settings"` and turn it off

\*_If you have `Prettier` set up for your VSCode, go to your User `settings.json` and add this below the `"editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"`_

```json
"[csharp]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "ms-dotnettools.csharp"
    },
```
